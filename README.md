# Optimization Constants in Mathematics

A curated collection of optimization constants $C$ in mathematics, often arising from solving a variational problem, or finding the best constant in a functional inequality.  This repository is focused on recording the best known upper and lower bounds on constants that have an active literature, and encourages crowdsourced contributions and updates (see [here](CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to contribute).

- Here is an initial blog post introducing the project: [A crowdsourced repository for optimization constants?](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2026/01/22/a-crowdsourced-repository-for-optimization-constants/), 22 Terence Tao, January 2026.

## Table of Constants

We are arbitrarily numbering the constants as $C\_{1}$, $C\_{2}$, etc., mostly based on the order in which the constants were added to the repository.
