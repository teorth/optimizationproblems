# The irrationality measure of $\pi$

## Description of constant

We define $C\_{7}$ to be the irrationality measure of $\pi$:

$C\_{7} := \sup\_{\mu\in\mathbb{R}} \mu$ such that $\lvert \pi - p/q \rvert < q^{-\mu}$ for infinitely many rationals $p/q$.

Equivalently, $C\_{7}$ is the infimum of all $\nu$ such that for every $\varepsilon>0$ there exists $q\_{0}(\varepsilon)$ with

$$\left|\pi-\frac{p}{q}\right| > \frac{1}{q^{\nu+\varepsilon}}$$

for all integers $p$ and all integers $q \ge q\_{0}(\varepsilon)$.

## Additional comments and links

- It is widely conjectured that $C\_{7}=2$ (as holds for Lebesgue-a.e. real number), but no improvement over the universal lower bound $2$ is currently known.
- Many upper bounds come from constructing explicit rational approximations to $\pi$ (often via special integrals or hypergeometric constructions) and then converting these to irrationality-measure estimates; see [B2000] for an accessible overview up to Hata's work.
