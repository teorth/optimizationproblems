# Maximal number of relevant variables in degree-$d$ Boolean functions

## Description of constant

Let 
$$
f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}
$$
be a Boolean function. Let $\deg(f)$ denote the degree of the unique multilinear polynomial over $\mathbb{R}$ that agrees with $f$ on {0,1}^n.

A variable $x_i$ is **relevant** if $f$ depends on it (equivalently: $x_i$ appears in some monomial with nonzero coefficient in the multilinear representation of $f$).

For integers $1\le d\le n$, define $R_{d,n}$ as the maximum possible number of relevant variables among Boolean functions 
$$
f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\} 
$$
of degree exactly $d$. Let $R_d := \sup_{n\ge d} R_{d,n}$, and set $C_{44} := \sup_{d\ge 1} \frac{R_d}{2^d}.$


Equivalently, $C_{44}$ is the smallest constant $C$ such that every Boolean function $f$ has at most $C\ 2^{\deg(f)}$ relevant variables. 

The finiteness of $C_{44}$ (i.e. existence of a universal constant $C$) follows from the work of Chiarelli–Hatami–Saks.

## Known lower bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| $1$ | [CHS2020] | A complete read-once decision tree of depth $d$ has degree $d$ and uses $2^d-1$ distinct variables, so $R_d\ge 2^d-1$. |
| $3/2$ | [CHS2020] | Construction with $R_d \ge 3\cdot 2^{d-1}-2$, hence $\sup_d R_d/2^d \ge 3/2$. (Also observed by Shinkar and Tal.) |

## Additional comments

* Best currently-known interval:  $\frac{3}{2}\le C_{44}\le 4.394.$
* For monotone Boolean functions, Wellens proves a smaller constant ($1.325$) multiplying $2^{\deg(f)}$.
