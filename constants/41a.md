# Moving Sofa Constant

## Description of constant

The moving sofa constant $C\_{41}=A$ is the maximum area of a connected, rigid planar shape that can maneuver through an L-shaped corridor of unit width.
The corridor is formed by two semi-infinite strips of width 1 meeting at a right angle.
The problem asks for the shape of the largest area (the "sofa") that can be moved from one end of the corridor to the other by a continuous rigid motion (translation and rotation).

## Known upper bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| $2 \sqrt{2}$ | [Hammersley1968] | |
| 2.37 | [KR2018] | Best published bound, using a computer-assisted proof scheme |
| 2.2195 | [Baek2024] | Announced bound, matching the Gerver construction |

## Known lower bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| $\pi/2 + 2/\pi$ | [Hammersley1968] | |

## Additional comments and links

- First appears in print in [Moser1966].
- It was claimed in a recent preprint [Baek2024] that Gerver's sofa [Gerver1992] is the optimal solution, which if true would solve the moving sofa problem.
- AlphaEvolve was able to numerically locate Gerver's sofa as a proposed maximizer, though without a proof of optimality [GGSWT2025].
