# Turan's pure power sum constant

## Description of constant

The constant $C_{42}$ is $\limsup_{n\to \infty}R_n$, where
\[R_n=\min\max_{1\leq k\leq n} \left\lvert \sum_{1\leq i\leq n}z_i^k\right,\]
where the minimum is taken over all $z_1,\ldots,z_n\in \mathbb{C}$ with $\max_i \lvert z_i\rvert=1$.

## Known upper bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| 1 | Trivial |  |
| 5/6 | Bir\'{o} [Bir00] | |
| 0.69368 | Harcos [Bir00] | |

## Known lower bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| 1/6 | Atkinson [Atk61] |  |
| $1/3$ | Atkinson | Mentioned in [Atk69] in a (presumably unpublished) technical report. |
| $\pi/8$ | Atkinson [Atk69] |  |
| 1/2 | Bir\'{o} [Bir94] |  |
| >1/2 | Bir\'{o} [Bir00b] | Bir\'{o}'s proof delivers some computable constant $1/2<c<1/\sqrt{2}$, but it is not computed there exactly which. |

## Additional comments

Computational investigations by Cheer and Goldston [CG96] suggest that $C_{42}$ is close to $0.7$. This problem is discussed at www.erdosproblems.com/519.
