# The KLS (Kannan–Lovász–Simonovits) constant for log-concave measures

$C_{20c}$ is the **KLS constant** (Kannan–Lovász–Simonovits constant) for log-concave measures.  It is defined as

$$
C_{20c} := \sup_{n\ge 1} \psi_n,
$$

where $\psi_n$ is the worst-case **inverse Cheeger (isoperimetric) constant** among *isotropic* log-concave probability measures on $\mathbb R^n$.

More precisely, let $\mu$ be a log-concave probability measure on $\mathbb R^n$ (i.e. $\mu$ has density $\rho(x)=e^{-V(x)}$ for some convex $V:\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R\cup\{+\infty\}$).  For a Borel set $A\subset\mathbb R^n$, define the (outer) Minkowski boundary measure

$$
\mu^+(A) := \liminf_{\varepsilon\to 0^+} \frac{\mu(A_\varepsilon)-\mu(A)}{\varepsilon},
\qquad
A_\varepsilon := \{x\in\mathbb R^n:\operatorname{dist}(x,A)\le \varepsilon\}.
$$

The **Cheeger constant** (isoperimetric coefficient) of $\mu$ is

$$
h_\mu := \inf_A \frac{\mu^+(A)}{\min(\mu(A),1-\mu(A))},
$$

and the corresponding inverse Cheeger constant is

$$
\psi_\mu := \frac{1}{h_\mu}.
$$

We say that $\mu$ is **isotropic** if it has barycenter $0$ and covariance matrix $\mathrm{Cov}(\mu)=I_n$.  One then defines

$$
\psi_n := \sup\{\psi_\mu : \mu \text{ is an isotropic log-concave probability measure on }\mathbb R^n\}.
$$

The **KLS conjecture** asserts that $C_{20c}<\infty$, i.e. that $\psi_n=O(1)$ uniformly in $n$ (and, in a stronger form, that the infimum defining $h_\mu$ is attained up to constants by half-spaces).

It is often convenient to work with the Poincaré (spectral gap) constant $C_P(\mu)$, defined as the smallest constant such that

$$
\mathrm{Var}_\mu(f)\le C_P(\mu)\int |\nabla f|^2\,d\mu
$$

for all smooth enough $f$.  For log-concave measures, $C_P(\mu)$ is equivalent up to universal factors to $\psi_\mu^2$; for instance one has

$$
\frac{1}{\pi}\,\psi_\mu^2 \ \le\ C_P(\mu)\ \le\ 4\,\psi_\mu^2.
$$

## Known upper bounds

Since a dimension-free upper bound is not known, bounds are stated for $\psi_n$ as a function of $n$.

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| $\psi_n \le C\sqrt{n}$ | [KLS1995] | First general polynomial bound (via localization lemma); more generally $\psi_\mu \le \sqrt{\mathrm{Tr}(\mathrm{Cov}(\mu))}$. |
| $\psi_n \le C n^{1/4}$ | [LV2024] | Improves the best previous polynomial exponent; based on stochastic localization. (Originally appeared in FOCS 2017.) |
| $\psi_n \le \exp\!\big(C\sqrt{\log n}\,\log\log n\big)$ | [Che2021] | First subpolynomial bound (equivalently, $\psi_n=n^{o(1)}$). |
| $\psi_n \le C(\log n)^5$ | [KL2022] | First polylogarithmic bound. |
| $\psi_n \le C(\log n)^{3.2226\ldots}$ | [JLV2022] | Improves the polylog exponent. |
| $\psi_n \le C(\log n)^{3.082\ldots}$ | [K2023] | Lehec (personal communication), as reported in [K2023]. |
| $\psi_n \le C\sqrt{\log n}$ | [K2023] | Current best general bound (Theorem 1.2 of [K2023]). |

## Known lower bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| $\sqrt{\pi/2} \approx 1.25331$ | Classical | For the standard Gaussian measure, isoperimetric minimizers are half-spaces and $h_\gamma=\sqrt{2/\pi}$, hence $\psi_\gamma=\sqrt{\pi/2}$. |

## Additional comments and links

- The KLS conjecture is central in asymptotic convex geometry, high-dimensional probability, and sampling algorithms for log-concave distributions.  In particular, a dimension-free bound $\psi_n=O(1)$ would imply near-optimal mixing bounds (up to polylog factors) for natural random walks such as the ball walk on isotropic convex bodies starting from a warm start.

- The KLS constant is closely related to the thin-shell constant $\sigma_n$ (see also $C_{20a}$): very roughly, stochastic localization shows that $\psi_n$ and $\sigma_n$ control one another up to logarithmic factors (so that the two problems are equivalent “up to logs”).

- A useful survey is [LV2018].
