## Matrix multiplication exponent

We define $C\_{15}$ to be the matrix multiplication exponent $\omega$, the smallest real number such that two $n \times n$ matrices over a field can be multiplied using $O(n^{\omega + o(1)})$ arithmetic operations.

## Additional comments and links

- The true value of $\omega$ affects the best possible running time of many other algorithms, including all-pairs shortest paths (APSP), transitive closure, and determinant computation.
- A survey of the topic can be found at [V2012a].
- The group-theoretic approach cannot obtain upper bounds better than 2.3725 [AHU2021].
