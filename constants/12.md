# The Beardwood–Halton–Hammersley constant

## Description of constant

$C\_{12} = \beta\_{2}$ is the constant such that the length $L\_{n}$ of the shortest tour through $n$ independent uniform random points satisfies $L\_{n}/\sqrt{n}\to \beta\_{2}$ almost surely.

## Known upper bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| $0.92117$ | [BHH1959] | Uses a strip-based constructive tour (horizontal slicing argument). Original reference contained some numerical errors [S2015] |
| $0.92117 - \frac{9}{16} 10^{-6}$  | [S2015] | Noted a slight improvement by allowing “zigzag” path corrections instead of a purely left-to-right tour.  |
| $<0.90304$ | [YC2023] | Latest computer-aided proof that significantly lowers the upper bound. Uses numerical integration and search over tour patterns. |



## Known lower bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| $0.625$ | [BHH1959] |Obtained by subadditivity and geometric arguments ensuring a minimum tour length contribution per point. |
| $0.625 + \frac{19}{10368} \approx 0.6268$ | [S2015] | A refined analysis using nearest-neighbor distances; contained errors fixed in [GJ2020]. |
| $0.6277$ | [GJ2020] | Improved rigorous lower bound using an approach based on nearest-neighbor distances, correcting and tightening a prior argument of [S2015]. |

## Additional comments and links

- Extensive experiments (using the Held–Karp relaxation and exact solvers) suggest that $\beta_2$ is about 0.71 to three significant figures. [JMR1996], [C2012]
