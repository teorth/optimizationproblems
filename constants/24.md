# Smallest unsolved instance of the Hadamard conjecture

## Description of constant

A **Hadamard matrix** of order $n$ is an $n\times n$ matrix $H$ with entries in $\{-1,1\}$ such that

$$
HH^{\top} = n I_n.
$$

Equivalently, the rows (and columns) are pairwise orthogonal.

It is known that Hadamard matrices can exist only for $n=1,2$, or $n\equiv 0 \pmod{4}$.

We define $C_{24}$ to be the smallest integer $n\equiv 0 \pmod{4}$ such that there is **no** Hadamard matrix of order $n$.
If no such $n$ exists, we set $C_{24}=\infty$.

The **Hadamard conjecture** asserts that $C_{24}=\infty$, i.e. that Hadamard matrices exist for every order $n\equiv 0 \pmod{4}$.

(Equivalently, by Hadamard’s determinant inequality, for $A\in\{-1,1\}^{n\times n}$ one has
$|\det(A)|\le n^{n/2}$, with equality iff $A$ is Hadamard; the conjecture predicts equality is attainable for all $n\equiv 0\pmod4$.)

## Known upper bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| $\infty$ | Trivial | No finite upper bound is known; conjecturally sharp (Hadamard conjecture). |

## Known lower bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| $4$ | Trivial | By definition $C_{24}$ (if finite) is a multiple of $4$. |
| $668$ | [CP2024] | All orders $n<668$ with $n\equiv 0\pmod4$ are known to admit Hadamard matrices; the smallest currently unresolved order is $668$. |

## Additional comments and links

- A benchmark open instance is the existence of a Hadamard matrix of order $668$; in the range $n\le 1208$, the only unresolved orders are $668,716,892,1132$ [CP2024].
- Classical infinite families of Hadamard orders include:
  - Sylvester’s Kronecker-product construction, giving Hadamard matrices of order $2^m$ for every $m\ge 0$ [Syl1867].
  - Paley’s constructions, giving Hadamard matrices of order $q+1$ when $q$ is a prime power with $q\equiv 3\pmod{4}$, and of order $2(q+1)$ when $q$ is a prime power with $q\equiv 1\pmod{4}$ [Pal1933].
