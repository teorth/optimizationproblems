# The Gyamarti-Hennecart-Ruzsa sum-difference constant

## Description of constant

$C\_{3a}$ is the largest constant such that there exist arbitrarily large sets $A,B$ of integers such that
$$ |A+B| \ll |A|$$
and
$$ |A-B| \gg |A+B|^{C\_{3a}}.$$

## Additional comments and links

- Thanks to a lemma from [GHR2007], any finite set $U$ of non-negative integers containing zero yields a lower bound of the form
$C\_{3a} \geq 1 + \log( \lvert U-U \rvert /\lvert U+U \rvert )/\log(2 \max(U)+1)$.  However, the lower bounds obtained in this fashion cannot exceed $1.25$.
