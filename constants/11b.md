# The critical exponent for isoperimetric inequality on the hamming cube

## Description of constant

Let $Q_{n} =$ {-1,1}^n be the Hamming cube (two vertices are adjacent if they differ in exactly one coordinate).
For a set $A \subset Q_{n}$ define the function $h_{A}:Q_{n}\to$ {0,1,...,n} by

- $h_{A}(x)=0$ if $x\notin A$;
- if $x\in A$, then $h_{A}(x)$ is the number of neighbors of $x$ that lie in the complement $A^c$.


Let $x$ be uniformly distributed on $Q_{n}$, and write $\mathbb{E}$ for expectation.
Then $C_{11b}$ is the infimum of all exponents $\beta>0$ such that for every $n\ge 1$ and every set
$A\subset Q_n$ of cardinality $2^{n-1}$ one has

$$
\mathbb{E} (h_{A}(x))^\beta \ \ge \frac{1}{2}.
$$

(For a codimension-1 subcube $A$ one has $h_{A}(x)=1$ on $A$ and $0$ on $A^c$, so the left-hand side equals $1/2$ for every $\beta>0$.)

## Known upper bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| $1$ | Classical (e.g. [Har1966]) | Follows from the edge isoperimetric inequality; equality for a codimension-1 subcube |
| $\log_2(3/2)\approx 0.58496$ | [KP2020] | In particular implies $\mathbb{E}h_{A}^\beta \ge 1/2$ for all half-size $A$ |
| $0.53$ | [BIM2023] | Sharp inequality of the form $\mathbb{E}h_{A}^{0.53}\ge 2\mu(A)(1-\mu(A))$ for $\mu(A)\ge 1/2$; gives the half-size case |
| $0.50057$ | [DIR2024] | Current best published; Theorem 1.1 implies the half-size case |

## Known lower bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| $0.5$ | [BIM2023] | For every $\beta<1/2$, Hamming ball examples give half-size sets with $\mathbb{E}h_{A}(x)^\beta$ arbitrarily small as $n\to\infty$ |

## Additional comments and links

- Conjecturally $C_{11b}=1/2$ (this is the $k=1$ case of the “subcubes are extremizers” conjecture in [DIR2024]).
- At the critical exponent $\beta=0.5$, [DIR2024, Thm. 1.4] gives the near-sharp estimate

  $\mathbb{E} (h_{A}(x))^{1/2} \ge 0.4985$ for any $n\geq 1$ and any set $A \subset Q_{n}$ of cardinality $2^{n-1}$

  so the conjectured half-size inequality at $\beta=0.5$ is known up to about $1.5\times 10^{-3}$ in the moment value [arXiv:2407.12674](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12674)

- **Connection to the Kahn--Park conjecture (cube separation).** Kahn and Park [KP2020] conjectured that there exists an absolute constant $K>0$ such that for every partition $(A,B,W)$ of the $n$-dimensional Hamming cube with $\mu(A)=1/2$ (here $\mu$ is the uniform probability measure) we have
 
$$
|\nabla(A,B)| + K\sqrt{n}\ \mu(W) \ge \frac12,
$$
  
  where $|\nabla(A,B)|$ denotes the *normalized* number of edges with one endpoint in $A$ and the other in $B$ (i.e. $2^{-n}$ times the number of such edges).
  Any admissible exponent $\beta$ in the definition of $C_{11b}$ implies the weaker bound with $\sqrt n$ replaced by $n^{\beta}$.
  Thus, improving the upper bound on $C_{11b}$ gives partial progress towards the Kahn--Park conjecture; if $C_{11b}=0.5$, then the conjecture would follow (in fact with $K=1$).
