# Shannon capacity of the 7-cycle

## Description of constant

Let ${\mathcal C}_{7}$ denote the cycle graph on $7$ vertices.
We define $C_{7}$ to be the **Shannon capacity** of ${\mathcal C}_{7}$:

$$
C_{7} := \Theta({\mathcal C}_{7}),
$$

where for a graph $G$, the Shannon capacity $\Theta(G)$ is defined by
$$
\Theta(G) := \sup_{n \ge 1} \alpha(G^{\boxtimes n})^{1/n}.
$$
Here $\alpha(H)$ denotes the independence number of a graph $H$, and $\boxtimes$
is the strong graph product.

## Additional comments and links

- Equivalently, $\Theta(G)$ is the maximum zero-error information rate of a noisy
channel whose confusability graph is $G$.
-  Determining $\Theta({\mathcal C}_{2k+1})$ for odd cycles is a central open problem in information theory and extremal combinatorics.
- For ${\mathcal C}_{5}$, Lovász famously proved $\Theta({\mathcal C}_{5})=\sqrt{5}$, but no exact value is
  known for $\Theta({\mathcal C}_{7})$.
- It is widely conjectured that $\Theta({\mathcal C}_{2k+1})=\vartheta({\mathcal C}_{2k+1})$ for all $k$,
  but this is currently open beyond $k=2$.
