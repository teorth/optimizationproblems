# Smallest $n$ for which the value of $BB(n)$ is undecidable

## Description of constant

$C\_{14}$ is the smallest $n$, such the the value of the busy beaver number $BB(n)$ is undecidable in ZFC (or equivalently ZF). Explicitly, it is the smallest $n$ such that there is a Turing machine with $n$ states for which it cannot be proven in ZFC (assuming ZFC is consistent) whether it halts or not.

The existence of $C\_{14}$ essentially follows from Gödel's second incompleteness theorem and the fact that Turing machines are strong enough to encode ZF.

## Additional comments

- Scott Aaronson conjectured in [S2020] that $C\_{14} \leq 20$.
- A discussion of this topic can be found in the ["Independence of ZFC" entry in the Busy Beaver Challenge Wiki](https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Independence_from_ZFC).
