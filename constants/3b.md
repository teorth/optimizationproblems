# Kakeya-type sum-difference constant

## Description of constant

$C\_{3b} = SD(\{0,1,\infty\};-1)$ is the least exponent such that one has the inequality
$$ |A \stackrel{G}{+} B| \leq \max(|A|, |B|, |A \stackrel{G}{-} B|)^{C\_{13}}$$
whenever $A, B$ are finite subsets of reals and $G \subset A \times B$, where
$$ A \stackrel{G}{\pm} B := \{ a \pm b: a \in A, b \in B\}.$$

## Additional comments and links

- Has many other formulations [GR2019], including an entropy formulation: $C\_{3b}$ is the smallest constant such that for any pair of discrete random variables $X,Y$ one has
$$ H(X,Y) \leq C\_{3b} \max( H(X), H(Y), H(X-Y)).$$
- In [B1999] it was observed that Kakeya sets in dimension $d$ have Minkowski and Hausdorff dimension at least $\frac{d-1}{C\_{3b}} + 1$. (This is no longer the best bound in any dimension.)
- Related to the arithmetic Kakeya conjecture [KT2002], [GR2019], which considers other sets of slopes than $0,1,\infty$.
