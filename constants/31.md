# Chvátal–Sankoff constant for a binary alphabet

## Description of constant

Let $\lambda\_{n,2}$ be the random variable assigning two uniformly random binary strings of length $n$ the length of their longest common subsequence.
Then $C\_{31}$ is the (well-defined) limit $C\_{31} := \lim\_{n \to \infty}\frac{\mathbb{E}[\lambda\_{n,2}]}{n}$.
